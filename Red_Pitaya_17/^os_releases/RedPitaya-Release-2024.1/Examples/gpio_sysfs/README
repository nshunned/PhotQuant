Simple C gpio test application shows how to export/unexport different pins and 
set direction on exported pins. 

Usaly exporting and setting direction to pins is done in external script that sets up all 
required gpio in this example that is done using "system" call(same can also be achived using calls to functions open read and write).

Actual read and writes on /sys/class/gpio/gpio_PIN_NO_/value (where _PIN_NO_ represents pin number of 
exported pin) is done with simple open, read and write comands. 

If you connect pins DIO0_N to DIO0_P using jumper wire, value read from PIN DIO0_P 
should match value written to POUT DIO0_P.
