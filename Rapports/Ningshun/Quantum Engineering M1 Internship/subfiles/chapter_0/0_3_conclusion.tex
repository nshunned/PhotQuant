The effort to eliminate the experimental dependence on LabVIEW, the now costly proprietary programming language, is very promising. We determined that the NI PXI-6713 Analog Output module can be programmed with open source languages such as Python or C, and the NI 6581 Digital I/O can essentially be replaced by the Digilent Cmod A7-35T.

For the NI 5761 Analog Input module, which we hope to replace with the Red Pitaya, we determined that the Deep Memmory Acquisition feature is the best method for data acquisition. More research and work are currently underway to tweak the Red Pitaya so that it can acquire data discontinuously according to experimental needs.
