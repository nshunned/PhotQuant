This chapter presents a short theoretical background of the experiment, with an introduction to Rydberg atoms and their properties, as well as an overview of the experimental setup. It concludes with a demonstration of my research internship's central problem, which revolved around migrating software programs and hardware devices used in the experiment for digital and analog I/O purposes.
