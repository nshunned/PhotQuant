This chapter contains the bulk of my internship work. It elaborates the exploration of hardware alternatives to the NI 6581 Digital I/O and NI 5761 Analog Input modules that challenged software migration away from LabVIEW, due to proprietary encryption associated with the hardware.

In order to familiarize myself with the basics of FPGA and HDL, I started learning to program the Digilent Cmod A7-35T module that could replace the NI 6581 module for digital I/O purposes. Then I proceeded to learn to operate and to explore the capabilities of the Red Pitaya STEMlab 125-14 module, a more complex single-board computer with the potential of replacing the NI 5761 module for analog input purposes.
